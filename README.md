# school-21-libft
This is my very first project at school 21. A little lib with some funcs from standard library.
Please, if you have any advice about refactoring and any tips or haks about this proj, i'll meet you as a friend)

The subj of project is to write your own lib  that reproduces some funcs from standard lib and works with makefile(it mustn't relink)
I hope you won't cry
